# C Data Structures Library

A lightweight and efficient collection of data structures implemented in C. This library is built for performance, clarity, and flexibility ‚Äî suitable for systems programming, embedded development, and educational purposes.

## ‚úÖ Current Features

- **Vector (Dynamic Array)**
  - Automatically resizes as elements are added or removed.
  - Supports random access, insertion, deletion.
  - Optional element cleanup (custom free functions).

- **Doubly Linked List**
  - Supports forward and backward traversal.
  - Efficient insertion and deletion at both ends and in the middle.
  - Converted from an initial singly linked list implementation.
 
- **Stack**
  - Array-based and/or linked-list based.
  - LIFO operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`.
 
- **Queue**
  - Circular buffer or linked-list based.
  - FIFO operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

The following data structures are planned for implementation:

- **Hash Map**
  - String and integer key support.
  - Separate chaining or open addressing.

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  - Insert, delete, search operations.
  - Can be extended into self-balancing trees later.

- **Heap / Priority Queue**
  - Min-heap or max-heap.
  - Useful for scheduling, graph algorithms, etc.

- **Graph**
  - Adjacency list or matrix representation.
  - Support for DFS, BFS, shortest path algorithms.
